# Audio Stream App

## Overview
The Audio Stream App is designed for real-time voice streaming, allowing users to amplify their voice through a connected speaker. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to address a large audience without the availability of a traditional microphone and speaker setup. By utilizing this app, you can connect your Android device to a speaker via Bluetooth (or any other audio output method) and broadcast your voice using the phone's microphone.

- Real-time audio streaming from the microphone to a connected speaker.
- Simple user interface with start and stop controls for streaming.
